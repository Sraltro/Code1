Code for group project 
G12 Bioentrep

Pseudocode:
Assign variables to pins.
  Variable for digital pin 2 (motor).
  Variable for A0 pin (sound sensor).
Coding how the Arduino will work.
If sound level between 70 and 85,
  motor  run for 300 milliseconds.
  motor off
If sound level 86 and above, 
  motor will run for 800 milliseconds,
  turn off for 400 milliseconds,  
  repeat 2 more times.
